We develop an ensemble neural model that trains on a concatenated statement representation combining contextual word embeddings, meta-data encodings, and feature representations drawn from the linguistic literature â€“ a slew of the best extant approaches.

We obtain the state of the art results on the LIAR dataset as of June 2019.
